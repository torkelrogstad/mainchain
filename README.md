Drivechain (BIPs 300+301)
-------------------------

Drivechain allows Bitcoin to create, delete, send BTC to, and receive BTC from “Layer-2”s called “sidechains”. Sidechains are Altcoins that lack a native “coin” – instead, BTC must first be sent over.

BIP 300:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0300.mediawiki

BIP 301:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0301.mediawiki
